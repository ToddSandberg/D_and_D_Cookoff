# Cookoff

Cookoff is a work in progress Dungeons and Dragons system where the main conflict is resolved by cooking. It is inspired by the manga Dungeon Meshi as well as the game Battle Chef Brigade.

Based on Cecilia D'Anastasio's [article](https://kotaku.com/stay-with-me-here-dungeons-dragons-except-you-cook-1807627184) on Kotaku.com, players dishes are judged by their ingenuity as well as their skills. Food is based on preparation (dex/strength), knowledge (int/wisdom), aesthetics (charisma), creativity and rarity.
